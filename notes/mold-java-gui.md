Install Windows 10 64bit in my dell PC

sfnet_generalutils/downloads/Java/jdk-6u21-windows-i586.exe/

And install git and now myschoo-output is readonly clone and back to commit before remove.

“The GUI builder had  built-in support for JSR 295 (Beans Binding technology), but the support for JSR 296 (Swing Application Framework) was removed in 7.1.”
