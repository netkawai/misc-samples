Plato

Phaedrus  By Plato
Plato:He would be a very simple person, and quite a stranger to the oracles of Thamus or Ammon,
who should leave in writing or receive in writing any art under the ideathat the written word would be intelligible or certain;
or who deemed that writing was at all better than knowledge and recollection of the same matters?
Phaedr: That is most true.
Plato: I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life,
and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches.
You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them,
the speaker always gives one unvarying answer.
And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them,
and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them;
and they cannot protect or defend themselves.
Phaedr: That again is most true.
Plato: Is there not another kind of word or speech far better than this, and having far greater power-a son of the same family, but lawfully begotten?
Phaedr: Whom do you mean, and what is his origin?
Plato: I mean an intelligent word graven in the soul of the learner, which can defend itself, and knows when to speak and when to be silent.
Phaedr: You mean the living word of knowledge which has a soul, and of which written word is properly no more than an image?
Plato: Yes, of course that is what I mean. And now may I be allowed to ask you a question: Would a husbandman, who is a man of sense,
take the seeds, which he values and which he wishes to bear fruit, and in sober seriousness plant them during the heat of summer,
in some garden of Adonis, that he may rejoice when he sees them in eight days appearing in beauty?
at least he would do so, if at all, only for the sake of amusement and pastime.But when he is in earnest he sows in fitting soil, and practises husbandry,
and is satisfied if in eight months the seeds which he has sown arrive at perfection?
‹th› for /θ/ and /ð/
Though English speakers take it for granted, the digraph ‹th› is in fact not an obvious combination for a dental fricative.
The origins of this have to do with developments in Greek.Proto-Indo-European had an aspirated /dʱ/ which came into Greek as /tʰ/,
spelled with the letter theta.
In the Greek of Homer and Plato this was still pronounced /tʰ/, and therefore when Greek words were borrowed into Latin Theta was transcribed
with ‹th›. Since /tʰ/ sounds like /t/ with a following puff of air, ‹th› was the logical spelling in the Latin alphabet.
By the time of New Testament Greek (koiné), however, the aspirated stop had shifted to a fricative: /tʰ/→/θ/.
Thus Theta came to have the sound which it still has in Modern Greek,
and which it represents in the IPA.
From a Latin perspective, the established digraph ‹th› now represented the voiceless fricative /θ/, and
was used thus for English by French-speaking scribes after the Norman Conquest,
since they were unfamiliar with the Germanic graphemes ð (eth) and þ (thorn).
Likewise, the spelling ‹th› was used for /θ/ in Old High German prior to the completion of the High German consonant shift,
again by analogy with the way Latin represented the Greek sound.
The history of the digraphs ‹ph› for /f/
Eth(ð)
In Old English, ð (referred to as ðæt by the Anglo-Saxons) was used interchangeably with þ (thorn) to represent either voiced or voiceless dental fricatives. The letter ð was used throughout the Anglo-Saxon era, but gradually fell out of use in Middle English.
Lower-case eth is used as a symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), again for a voiced dental fricative, and in IPA usage, the name of the symbol is pronounced with the same voiced sound, as /ɛð/. (The IPA symbol for the voiceless dental fricative is θ.)
The modern Greek letter delta (Δ, δ) has, in general, the same phonetic value.(In Ancient Greek, delta represented a d sound.)
What's the odds?Even if we make a lot of efforts, we can not always archieve success.It is important to convince myself.
If I can't master the english pronounciation,I will give up and refuse english.I should avoid the situation.
There is the obvious differences.How do I adapt myself to English world.That is issue.
