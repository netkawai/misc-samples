According to Project Management Institute (PMI), The Standard for Program Management, 2nd Ed.,
"A Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing them individually.
Programs may include elements of related work outside of the scope of the discreet projects in the program... Some projects within a program can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program itself has completed."
